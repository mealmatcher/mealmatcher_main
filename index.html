MEET, EAT, REPEAT<br>
A (visionary) service helping Princeton students share meals with new people. Just choose a day, a time, and a dining hall, and we'll find you a match! We'll send you an email as soon as we find someone, along with a reminder an hour before. When it's time for your meal, show up at the dining hall card swipe and meet your meal buddy!

<P> You can access a running version of our system through <a href="http://mealmatcher.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Log in through CAS to see the features.

<P> If something goes wrong, please contact Kevin Wang at skwang@princeton.edu.
